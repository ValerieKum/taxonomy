## Celestia Space Assurance Corporation

Established in 2001 to meet the emerging demand for specialized risk management in the privatizing space sector, Celestia Space Assurance Corporation initially focused on insuring satellite launches and orbital assets. The 2010s saw rapid expansion as commercial entities like SpaceX and Blue Origin transformed the industry. With the global space economy exceeding $500 billion by the early 2020s, Celestia broadened its services to include manned missions, lunar infrastructure, and interplanetary exploration. By 2025, amid renewed geopolitical interest in lunar and Martian endeavors and increased civilian spaceflight, Celestia emerged as a leader in space travel insurance, integrating advanced actuarial models with international legal compliance to support both governmental and private clients.

In the early 21st century, as space exploration shifted from government-led initiatives to private ventures, Celestia Space Assurance Corporation was founded in 2001 to address the growing need for specialized risk management. Starting with satellite and orbital asset insurance, the company expanded in the 2010s alongside industry disruptors like SpaceX and Blue Origin. As the global space economy surpassed $500 billion in the early 2020s, Celestia developed policies for manned missions, lunar projects, and interplanetary travel. By 2025, with heightened interest in lunar and Martian exploration and a surge in civilian space participation, Celestia solidified its position as a leader in space travel insurance, balancing sophisticated risk models with adherence to international space law.

The privatization of space exploration in the early 2000s prompted the establishment of Celestia Space Assurance Corporation in 2001, aiming to provide specialized risk management solutions. Initially concentrating on satellite and orbital asset insurance, the company experienced significant growth during the 2010s, paralleling the rise of commercial space enterprises such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. With the global space economy exceeding $500 billion by the early 2020s, Celestia expanded its offerings to encompass manned missions, lunar infrastructure, and interplanetary exploration. By 2025, in response to increased geopolitical interest in lunar and Martian activities and growing civilian involvement in spaceflight, Celestia had established itself as a leading provider of space travel insurance, integrating advanced actuarial methodologies with international legal compliance to support both governmental and private sector clients.

This document outlines the internal processes for setting up space travel insurance policies for clients, guidelines for legal compliance, and protocols for informing and selling to clients. These points must be reiterated, complied with, and properly documented in all client interactions.

## Key Space Missions and Insurance Relevance

Agents must familiarize themselves with the following missions and advancements to offer appropriate coverage:

## Manned Missions:
