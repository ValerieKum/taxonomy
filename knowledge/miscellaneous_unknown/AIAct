      The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) establishes a risk-based framework for AI applications within the European Union. It categorizes AI systems into four risk levels: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal. Unacceptable-risk AI systems, such as those involving social scoring or real-time biometric identification in public spaces, are prohibited. High-risk AI systems, including those used in critical infrastructure, education, and employment, must adhere to strict requirements like conformity assessments, transparency obligations, and human oversight. The Act also introduces specific provisions for general-purpose AI models, mandating transparency and risk management measures.

      - question: |
          What are the four risk categories defined in the EU AI Act?
        answer: |
          The EU AI Act classifies AI systems into four risk categories: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal.
      - question: |
          Are AI systems used for social scoring permitted under the EU AI Act?
        answer: |
          No, AI systems used for social scoring are considered unacceptable risk and are prohibited under the EU AI Act.
      - question: |
          What obligations do high-risk AI systems have under the EU AI Act?
        answer: |

      South Korea's AI Framework Act, enacted in 2024, represents the first comprehensive AI regulation in the Asia-Pacific region. The Act aims to balance innovation with safety by establishing guidelines for AI development and deployment. It mandates risk assessments for AI systems, promotes transparency, and sets standards for data quality and human oversight. The Act also outlines the creation of an AI Ethics Committee to oversee ethical considerations in AI applications.

  - context: |
      In 2023, China implemented binding regulations on generative AI services. These regulations require developers to obtain government approval before public deployment of generative AI models. The guidelines emphasize alignment with Core Socialist Values, mandate content moderation, and enforce data security measures. Developers must also ensure that AI-generated content does not discriminate or spread false information.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the key requirements of China's 2023 generative AI regulations?
        answer: |
          Developers must obtain government approval before deployment, ensure alignment with Core Socialist Values, implement content moderation, and enforce data security measures.
      - question: |
          Do China's generative AI regulations address misinformation?
        answer: |
          Yes, the regulations require that AI-generated content does not spread false information and includes mechanisms for content moderation.
